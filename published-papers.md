### ðŸ“„ _Paper 02: **Benchmarking ChatGPT, Codeium, and GitHub Copilot: A Comparative Study of AI-Driven Programming and Debugging Assistants**_

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

With the increasing adoption of AI-driven tools in software development, **large language models (LLMs)** have become essential for tasks like **code generation, bug fixing**, and **optimization**. Tools like **ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot**, and **Codeium** provide valuable assistance in solving programming challenges, yet their effectiveness remains underexplored.

This paper presents a **comparative study** of the three tools, evaluating their performance on **LeetCode problems** across varying difficulty levels and categories. Key metrics such as **success rates, runtime efficiency, memory usage**, and **error-handling capabilities** are assessed. GitHub Copilot showed **superior performance on easier and medium tasks**, while ChatGPT **excelled in memory efficiency and debugging**. Codeium, though promising, struggled with more complex problems.

Despite their strengths, **all tools faced challenges on harder problems**. These insights provide a deeper understanding of each tool's capabilities and limitations, offering **guidance for developers and researchers** seeking to optimize AI integration in coding workflows.

### ðŸ“„ _Paper 01: **PhishGuard: A Multi-Layered Ensemble Model for Optimal Phishing Website Detection**_

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Phishing attacks are a growing cybersecurity threat, leveraging deceptive techniques to steal sensitive information through malicious websites. To combat these attacks, this paper introduces **PhishGuard**, an optimal custom ensemble model designed to improve phishing site detection. The model combines multiple machine learning classifiers, including **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost**, and **XGBoost**, to enhance detection accuracy.

Through advanced feature selection methods such as **SelectKBest** and **RFECV**, and optimizations like **hyperparameter tuning** and **data balancing**, the model was trained and evaluated on **four publicly available datasets**. PhishGuard outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving a detection accuracy of **99.05%** on one of the datasets, with similarly high results across others. This research demonstrates that **optimization methods in conjunction with ensemble learning greatly improve phishing detection performance**.
