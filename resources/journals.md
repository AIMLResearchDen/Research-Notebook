ðŸ§  Top 5 Journal Recommendations for Your AI/ML Mental Health Survey

1. ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) â€“ Q1

ACM Computing Surveys is the premier venue for survey articles in computer science. With an exceptional Impact Factor of 23.8, this Q1-ranked journal demands deep, structured, and analytical survey work. Ideal for your topic on AI and suicide detection, it requires a thorough taxonomy, a wide coverage of existing literature, and insightful identification of open challenges. The journal supports preprint submissions (like arXiv) and does not charge any APC unless you choose open access. While the review process is slow (4â€“6 months), the prestige and visibility make it worthwhile for foundational survey work.

2. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing â€“ Q1

This journal is a top-tier destination if your paper emphasizes emotional, behavioral, or affective components in AI. It covers technologies that detect or model emotionsâ€”making it a strong fit if your suicide detection survey includes sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, or mood modeling. It has an Impact Factor of 9.6 and is Q1-ranked in cybernetics and human-computer interaction. IEEE follows a traditional model with no APC, and it supports preprints. The review time is moderate (typically 2â€“4 months). Overall, it's ideal for technically rigorous surveys involving emotional AI systems in mental health.

3. Artificial Intelligence Review â€“ Q1

Published by Springer, this journal is dedicated to review and survey papers in AI. It welcomes well-researched and structured reviews across all AI subfields, including ML for health, affective computing, and societal impact. With an Impact Factor of 10.7 and Q1 ranking, it suits your paper if you cover methodological diversity and application breadth in suicide detection. There's no mandatory APC under its standard model. The review process takes about 3â€“5 months. If your survey is technically deep and well-organized, this is an excellent venue that balances quality and accessibility.

4. Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing (JAIHC) â€“ Q2

JAIHC focuses on how intelligent systems interact with humans in a natural, intuitive, and socially relevant way. It is a strong candidate for papers that explore AI systems for human well-being, making it very relevant to suicide prevention and mental health technology. It has an Impact Factor of \~4.8, ranked Q2, and offers optional open access (you can publish for free in the subscription model). The journal accepts surveys and tends to have a faster review process (\~2â€“3 months) compared to Q1 options. Itâ€™s a great middle ground between speed, visibility, and domain fit.

5. Cognitive Computation â€“ Q2

This Springer journal bridges AI with neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science. It focuses on brain-inspired computing, emotional intelligence, and socially aware systemsâ€”making it highly suitable if your paper covers neurocognitive models, affective computing, or intelligent behavior prediction in suicide detection. With an Impact Factor around 5.1 and Q2 ranking, it has good academic standing. It follows a traditional publishing model, with optional APCs. The journal accepts both original research and well-written reviews. Review times are moderate (2â€“3 months), and it's indexed in all major databases.
